			<p>Just recently graduated from Universiti Teknologi Mara, with a degree of Bachelor of Computer Science (Data Communications and Networking),she will be having her convocation in April 2018. Hooray!</p>
			<p>Adilla didn't know that she'd love technology as much as she loves potato chips (it's her true love I tell you) until she was in her second year in University.</p>
			<p>Exploring technology and creating new ideas are so therapeutic to her, she'd do it out of love.
			  Being in the RnD industry has always been her dream, after realizing that maybe one day she will come up with a robot doing all the sewing chores for her because she's..well, untalented in sewing.</p>
			<p>Immediately after finishing her studies, she did freelancing jobs while waiting for job opportunities.</p>
